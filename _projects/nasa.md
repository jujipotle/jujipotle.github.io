In the span of three months, I worked with a team of seven high school students to create a moonwalking simulation app in Unity. Our app constructed a mesh of the moon based on real-world terrain data provided by NASA. We also integrated features such as a first-person POV, a pathfinding algorithm, and a minimap.

Our app was named a winner of the 2020 NASA App Development Challenge.
