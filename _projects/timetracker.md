During my freshman year, I realized I needed a structured routine in my life. I was staying up late, skipping breakfast, and not hitting my gym goals. To regain focus, I started timetracking my daily activities. At first, my timetracker was just a notes document on my phone, tracking the time I spent on homework for each class. After a week, I realized I wanted more actionable data, so I migrated to Google Sheets and tracked thirty-minute intervals of my day.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/timetracker_early.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Since then, my timetracker has gone through multiple iterations. The current version operates on fifteen-minute intervals and includes automated formulas to tally weekly time spent on categories like classes, exercise, and sleep.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/timetracker_week.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/timetracker_stats.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

I've found timetracking incredibly useful for staying accountable in my day-to-day tasks and reflecting weekly. It helps me identify areas of my life that take up a lot of time but don’t align with my priorities.

My biggest takeaway from timetracking has been realizing how limited time is. It’s easy to spend days on tasks that don’t bring personal fulfillment. Timetracking helps me prioritize things that matter most to me—whether that's learning, spending time with friends and family, or pursuing hobbies.

I’d highly recommend giving timetracking a try, especially if you feel like there’s a lot you want to do but not enough time to do it. Feel free to reach out with questions about my template or how to start timetracking in your own life!
