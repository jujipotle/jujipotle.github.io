## Academic Interests
I’m passionate about AI interpretability research—understanding how AI models work internally to make them safer and more trustworthy for society. During my junior year, I collaborated with the [Harvard Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/) on a project investigating how language models adopt "personas" and designing interventions to influence them.

In high school, I did competitive programming and math (USACO Platinum, AIME). I’ve also competed in hackathons and enjoy building side projects that are both technically interesting and impactful. Check out some of my work in the [projects](/projects) tab.

Beyond AI interpretability, I’m interested in reinforcement learning, language model training. I also enjoy learning about data visualization, algorithmic game theory, literature, and writing.
